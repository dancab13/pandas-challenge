# pandas-challenge
Materials for the Pandas Module 4 challenge for the BCS Data Analytics boot camp.

The Jupyter Notebook file, PyCitySchools_Cabrera_Complete, has the code for this challenge. The code concepts come from class and lots of trial and error using the Pandas cheat sheet we got in class (and also reading the Pandas documentation). The cheat sheet is from: https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf. I learned the .replace method from Stack Overflow. Code was from the starter file that came with the challenge materials or it's my own. The code contains my analysis written in Markdown, so hopefully the formatting carries through.
